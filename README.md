nodejs
======
Made by CHristopher Durr
basically a simple form of lisp where you can do things like + 3 1 6 2 which is equivelant to 
3 + 1 + 6 + 2

run in terminal as nodejs lisp.js

Operators:

multiply
add or +
subtract or -
divide or /

use like this:

+ 3 1 5 2 6 

This does not use parentheses like lisp does.
I may or may not update this depending on how lazy I feel
